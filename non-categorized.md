# The answer to the questions of "What time ?"

You can say like "Fourteen hundred (1400) hours" which means 2pm. 

4am is "oh 4 hundred (0400) hours".

# Non-apology apology

Ref: [Wikipedia: "Non-apology apology" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-apology_apology)

> "I'm sorry you feel that way"

You can use that wording when someone gets upset to you but it's not your fault.

# An elephant in the room

The topic that we all know it's an issue but we're ignoring.

It's okay to replace "elephant" by "dinosaur" or something like that.

e.g.

> I'm talking about the elephant in the room
> We have an elephant in the room

# Brain fart

It's "ど忘れ" in Japanese

e.g. 

> I'm having brain fart

This is very casual so you can say instead:

> “my brain isn’t working"
> “It’s on the tip of my tongue"
